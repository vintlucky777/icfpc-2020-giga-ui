## About

Welcome to GIGA!

GIGA is a rich graphical UI that helps you replay past space battles that wreaked havok on other galaxies.
Our hope is that this UI would help the brightest and most talented of minds come up with ingenious battle tactics to defend our planet.
All of that is of course while experiencing the amazing visual effects, power by our never-patented CinemaFXD technology.

## Dog friendly

As the battles between intergalactic species may contain images, that can be percieved as graphical by various species, we had to conduct a series of
focus group tests on certain types of animals. My dog approves it, and so should you.

## Company

We are proud to be the company, that successfully implements the first commercial space flight... visualization. We hope you enjoy the view.
